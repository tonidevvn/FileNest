# Active Context

## Current Focus:
- Setting up the initial memory bank and project documentation.
- Understanding the existing project structure and technologies.
- Planning the implementation of core features, starting with user authentication and file upload.

## Recent Changes:
- Created initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps:
1.  **Complete Memory Bank Setup:** Create `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
2.  **Explore User Authentication:** Examine existing authentication mechanisms in `core/auth.py` and `api/auth.py`.
3.  **Implement File Upload:** Design and implement file upload functionality, starting with API endpoint and core service logic.
4.  **Update Progress Documentation:**  Reflect the completed steps and update `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Decide on the specific implementation approach for user authentication (e.g., JWT, session-based).
- Determine the file upload process, including size limits, allowed file types, and storage mechanism.
- Plan the API endpoints and data models for file upload functionality.
- Consider security aspects for both authentication and file upload features.
