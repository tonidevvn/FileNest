# Project Progress

## What Works:
- Basic Django project setup with API, core, web, and monitoring apps.
- Docker Compose environment for development.
- MinIO integration for object storage.
- User authentication and authorization (initial setup in `core/auth.py` and `api/auth.py`).
- Admin dashboard for monitoring (initial setup in `monitoring/`).

## What's Left to Build:
- **File Upload Functionality:** Implement API endpoint, core service, and web interface for file uploads.
- **File Organization:** Implement folders and tagging for file management.
- **File Sharing:** Implement secure file sharing with access control.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:**  Expand admin dashboard with more detailed monitoring metrics.
- **User Interface Improvements:** Enhance user experience and visual design of the web interface.
- **Testing and Documentation:**  Write unit tests and API documentation for all features.

## Current Status:
- Project setup and initial documentation are in progress.
- User authentication and authorization are partially implemented.
- File upload functionality is the next core feature to be implemented.

## Known Issues:
- None at this stage.
