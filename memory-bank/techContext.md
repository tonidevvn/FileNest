# Technical Context

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bulma CSS framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (configured in docker-compose.yml)
- **Object Storage:** MinIO
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

## Development Setup:
- Project is set up with Docker Compose for easy environment setup.
- Python dependencies are managed using `requirements.txt`.
- Django project structure is used for backend and monitoring components.
- Web interface is built with Django templates and static files.

## Technical Constraints:
- Adhere to existing project structure and technology stack.
- Ensure compatibility with Docker and Docker Compose setup.
- Consider performance and scalability when implementing new features.
- Maintain code quality and follow best practices.

## Dependencies:
- **Python Packages:** Listed in `requirements.txt` (Django, DRF, psycopg2, minio, etc.)
- **Docker Images:** PostgreSQL, MinIO (defined in `docker-compose.yml`)

## API Endpoints:
- Refer to `api/urls.py` for defined API endpoints.
- API documentation can be generated using DRF's browsable API or tools like Swagger.

## Django Settings:
- Project settings are configured in `FileNest/settings.py`.
- Database and MinIO settings are configured using environment variables (defined in `docker-compose.yml`).
